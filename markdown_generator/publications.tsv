2018-04-16	Discrete disorder models for many-body localization	Physical Review B	Using exact diagonalization technique, we investigate the many-body localization phenomenon in the 1D Heisenberg chain comparing several disorder models. In particular we consider a family of discrete distributions of disorder strengths and compare the results with the standard uniform distribution. Both statistical properties of energy levels and the long time nonergodic behavior are discussed. The results for different discrete distributions are essentially identical to those obtained for the continuous distribution, provided the disorder strength is rescaled by the standard deviation of the random distribution. Only for the binary distribution significant deviations are observed.	Jakub Janarek, Dominique Delande, and Jakub Zakrzewski, Phys. Rev.

2020-07-06	Quantum boomerang effect for interacting particles	Physical Review A	When a quantum particle is launched with a finite velocity in a disordered potential, it may surprisingly come back to its initial position at long times and remain there forever. This phenomenon, dubbed “quantum boomerang effect,” was introduced in Prat et al. [Prat, Delande, and Cherroret, Quantum boomeranglike effect of wave packets in random media, Phys. Rev. A 99, 023629 (2019)]. Interactions between particles, treated within the mean-field approximation, are shown to partially destroy the boomerang effect: the center of mass of the wave packet makes a U turn, but does not completely come back to its initial position. We show that this phenomenon can be quantitatively interpreted using a single parameter, the average interaction energy.

2022-05-26	Quantum boomerang effect in systems without time-reversal symmetry	Physical Review B	In an Anderson localized system, a quantum particle with a nonzero initial velocity returns, on average, to its origin. This recently discovered behavior is known as the quantum boomerang effect. Time-reversal invariance was initially thought to be a necessary condition for the existence of this phenomenon. We theoretically analyze the impact of the symmetry breaking on the phenomenon using a one-dimensional system with a spin-orbit coupling and show that the time-reversal invariance is not necessary for the boomerang effect to occur. We explain this behavior giving sufficient symmetry conditions for the boomerang effect to occur when time-reversal symmetry is broken.

2023-03-16	Many-body quantum boomerang effect	Physical Review B	We study numerically the impact of many-body interactions on the quantum boomerang effect. We consider various cases: weakly interacting bosons, the Tonks-Girardeau gas, and strongly interacting bosons (which may be mapped onto weakly interacting fermions). Numerical simulations are performed using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm, a quasiexact method based on matrix product states. In the case of weakly interacting bosons, we find a partial destruction of the quantum boomerang effect, in agreement with the earlier mean-field study [J. Janarek et al., Phys. Rev. A 102, 013303 (2020)]. For the Tonks-Girardeau gas, we show the presence of the full quantum boomerang effect. For strongly interacting bosons, we observe a partial boomerang effect. We show that the destruction of the quantum boomerang effect is universal and does not depend on the details of the interaction between particles.

2023-03-30	How do strokes affect the brain's critical state? Structural and functional aspects of the loss of connectome integrity	Scientific Reports (in-review)	This paper addresses the problem of the brain’s critical behavior in the case of a brain injury such as a stroke. Employing network models to simulate the post-stroke brain, we demonstrate that an anomalous behavior of the critical characteristics, the second-largest cluster size, results from the loss of integrity of the network, quantified within the graph theory, and not from genuine non-critical behavior. Thus, even in a post-stroke state, the brain dynamics remain critical. The proposed interpretation of the results is confirmed with the analysis of the real connectomes acquired from post-stroke patients and the control group. The results presented refer to neurobiological data; however, the conclusions reached apply to a broad class of complex systems for which a critical state is identified.
