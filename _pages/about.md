I am a theoretical physicist with a passion for neurosciences.

During my PhD studies, I explored the intricate domain of disordered quantum systems, studying the [Quantum Boomerang Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_boomerang_effect). This work ignited my interest in complexity and interdisciplinary projects, where state-of-the art methods of analysis are applied to problems at interfaces of various disciplines.

My current research focuses on two main areas: brain simulation and the application of machine learning techniques in neuroscience. I am interested in exploring ways to model and simulate the complex neural circuits and interactions that occur within the brain, which involves studying computational models that accurately represent the behavior of individual neurons and their interactions, as well as simulating the behavior of entire neural networks.

In addition to brain simulation, I am also passionate about applying machine learning techniques to neuroscience. This involves using statistical and computational methods to analyze large amounts of neural data and extract meaningful insights about brain function and behavior. I am particularly interested in developing machine learning algorithms that can identify patterns in neural activity or brain structure and use these insights to predict future behavior or diagnose neurological disorders.
